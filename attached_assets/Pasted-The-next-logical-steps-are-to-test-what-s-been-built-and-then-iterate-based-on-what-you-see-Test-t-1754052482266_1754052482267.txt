The next logical steps are to test what’s been built and then iterate based on what you see:

Test the login flow – Use the provided credentials for each role (waiter/password, cashier/password, manager/password). Make sure each account lands on the correct dashboard and that you can’t access pages you shouldn’t (e.g. a waiter should not reach the manager dashboard).

Walk through each workflow:

As a waiter, assign or select a table, add items to an order, mark it as paid (cash collection) and submit it. Confirm that the order appears on the cashier’s screen.

As a cashier/expeditor, change the order status from paid to in‑prep to ready, and watch the waiter’s dashboard update in real time.

As a manager, try creating/assigning tables and staff, updating menu items and viewing whatever reports or lists the generated project provides.

Check the data handling – Because you asked for a cash‑only system, confirm that there are no card‑payment fields or flows. Ensure the “paid” flag or equivalent is being set correctly when the waiter collects cash.

Review the codebase – If you plan to maintain or extend this app, take a quick tour through the server and client folders in Replit. Since the AI used TypeScript/Express/React, note how the interfaces are defined and how WebSocket events are handled. This will help you modify or add features later.

Address any TypeScript or runtime errors – Replit’s AI mentioned fixing some type issues. If the app still shows red squiggles or errors in the console, resolve those first; they might be as simple as adjusting the Express request types.

Decide on next priorities – Once the core flows work, you can:

Add analytics/reporting screens for the manager (e.g. sales by date, popular dishes).

Polish the UI/UX, including table assignment screens.

Connect to your own MongoDB instance instead of the test data.

After you’ve verified the existing functionality, feel free to share the repl link or describe any areas that aren’t working as expected—then we can dive into specific fixes or enhancements.
